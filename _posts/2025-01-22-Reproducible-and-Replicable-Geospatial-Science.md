I developed the [Geospatial Analytics Extension](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-geospatial-extension), [Dataverse Extension](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-dataverse-extension) and [Google Earth Engine Extension](https://github.com/spatial-data-lab/knime-gee-extension) for KNIME, enabling seamless spatial data processing, modeling, and visualization without code. These tools empower researchers to replicate analyses based on visual programming and alleviate programming anxiety, particularly for underrepresented groups, enhancing the fairness and democratization of data science.
