Early in my career, I used social media data to infer air quality in China, addressing the lack of monitoring stations. During my doctoral studies, I developed methods for urban waterlogging detection, including a network community evolution algorithm and a multimodal deep learning approach to estimate flood depth. These tools supported disaster management and urban resilience planning.
