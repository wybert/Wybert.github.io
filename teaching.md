## The Summer Workshop on Spatiotemporal Data Science at Harvard

I served as a lecturer at the [Summer Workshop on Spatiotemporal Data Science at Harvard](https://gis.harvard.edu/news/cga-hosted-spatiotemporal-data-science-workshop-and-symposium), which took place from July 10-15, 2023. You can explore the [curriculum here](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/chinadatalab/event/summer-workshop-spatiotemporal-innovation-0). This CGA-hosted event featured a five-day training workshop attended by eleven individuals, followed by a symposium that drew approximately seventy participants from 15 countries worldwide.

## Spatiotemporal Data Analysis With Codeless Visual Programming

I serve as a presenter at [ABCD](https://www.abcd.harvard.edu/)-GIS Seminar named [Spatiotemporal Data Analysis With Codeless Visual Programming](https://gis.harvard.edu/event/spatiotemporal-data-analysis-codeless-visual-programming) to introduce the KNIME Analytics Platform and its Geospatial Analytics extension developed by the Spatial Data Lab (SDL) team at Harvard's Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA). More than 40 people attended this seminar in person and online.
