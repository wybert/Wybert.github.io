## The Summer Workshop on Spatiotemporal Data Science at Harvard

I served as a lecturer at the [Summer Workshop on Spatiotemporal Data Science at Harvard](https://gis.harvard.edu/news/cga-hosted-spatiotemporal-data-science-workshop-and-symposium), which took place from July 10-15, 2023. You can explore the [curriculum here](https://projects.iq.harvard.edu/chinadatalab/event/summer-workshop-spatiotemporal-innovation-0). This CGA-hosted event featured a five-day training workshop attended by eleven individuals, followed by a symposium that drew approximately seventy participants from 15 countries worldwide.
